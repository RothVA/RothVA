## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm first year ICT student at LAB university of applied sciences. Currently studies have included: html web building and beginner programming, later with python. I'm also including japanese language to the studies.

Goals are simply to learn and grow to be efficient programmer, with versatile language skills and grounded problem solving skills.

Others than studies, my life include strongman training and current work in security services. *There might also be some D&D related nonsensical chaos in downtime.*
